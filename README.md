## CryptO

* This Repo is my "Safe zone" to experiment and familiarize myself with OpenSSL.
  * Please feel free to use the code if you think it might be helpful for you since OpenSSL documentation was written for aliens, perhaps these examples here will help you understand. Keep in mind that i am leaning to, so if you think that i did something the wrong way please create an issue and correct me i will greatly appreciate it.
